Tree
====
A hierarchical structure composed of nodes and edges. 

Overview
--------
A tree has a root node. 

Each node of a tree may have zero or more children.

A tree may not have cycles.

Nodes in a tree may have reference to their parent.

Nodes in a tree may have any type as a value.

A tree that may have at most two children is a binary tree, three a ternary tree, etc.

A node having no children is a leaf.

A tree where every node has two children except the last is a complete tree.

A complete tree is filled at every level except perhaps the last, and then, from left to right.
