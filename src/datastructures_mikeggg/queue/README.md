Queue
=====
Linear structure supporting first-in first-out retrieval.


Operations
----------
add(val)
get()
peek()
size()


Implementaion
-------------
Queues are typically implemented using either a linked-list or array.


Analysis
--------
Insertion is O(1).

Retrieval is O(1).

Insertion is always at one end, retrieval the other.




Uses
----
For storing items not to be processed immediately, but later, and in the order in which they were enqueued.

Breadth-first search
